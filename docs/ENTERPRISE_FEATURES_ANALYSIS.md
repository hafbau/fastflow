# Enterprise Features Analysis & Implementation Strategy

## What's Already Built in Core

After analyzing the codebase, ALL enterprise features are already implemented:

### 1. **Workspaces** ✅
- `core/packages/server/src/enterprise/database/entities/workspace.entity`
- Full CRUD operations
- Resource isolation
- Workspace switching

### 2. **Organizations** ✅
- `core/packages/server/src/enterprise/database/entities/organization.entity`
- Multi-workspace management
- Billing at org level

### 3. **RBAC (Role-Based Access Control)** ✅
- `core/packages/server/src/enterprise/rbac/`
- Fine-grained permissions
- Role management
- Resource-level access control

### 4. **SSO (Single Sign-On)** ✅
- Google, Azure, Auth0, GitHub
- `core/packages/server/src/enterprise/sso/`
- Fully configured providers

### 5. **Audit Logs** ✅
- Activity tracking
- Compliance features

## Quick Enable Strategy (For Testing)

### Step 1: Force Enterprise Mode
```javascript
// core/packages/server/src/IdentityManager.ts
// Around line 106, replace the license check with:

if (process.env.ENABLE_ENTERPRISE === 'true') {
    this.licenseValid = true
    this.currentInstancePlatform = Platform.ENTERPRISE
    return
}
```

### Step 2: Set Environment Variable
```bash
# In your .env
ENABLE_ENTERPRISE=true
OFFLINE=true  # Skip license server check
```

### Step 3: Initialize Database Tables
The enterprise tables will auto-create when you start the server.

## What This Gives You Immediately

1. **Full workspace management UI**
2. **User management interface**
3. **Role & permission system**
4. **Organization hierarchy**
5. **SSO configuration**
6. **Audit logs**

## Migration Strategy

### Phase 1: Learn (Week 1)
1. Enable enterprise features locally
2. Understand the data model
3. Test all features
4. Document what you need vs don't need

### Phase 2: Extract (Week 2)
1. Copy database schemas to your proxy
2. Extract permission logic
3. Build your own auth layer (Supabase)
4. Implement workspace isolation in proxy

### Phase 3: Customize (Week 3+)
1. Remove features you don't need
2. Add your custom features
3. Integrate with your billing
4. Custom UI on top

## Key Files to Study

### Database Entities:
- `workspace.entity.ts` - Workspace structure
- `organization.entity.ts` - Org hierarchy
- `role.entity.ts` - RBAC roles
- `workspace-user.entity.ts` - User-workspace mapping

### Services:
- `workspace.service.ts` - Workspace logic
- `organization.service.ts` - Org management
- `rbac.service.ts` - Permission checks

### Middleware:
- `passport.ts` - Auth flow
- `PermissionCheck.ts` - RBAC enforcement

## Legal Considerations

The Apache 2.0 license allows:
- ✅ Commercial use
- ✅ Modification
- ✅ Distribution
- ✅ Private use

But you must:
- Include the original copyright notice
- State changes made to the code
- Include the NOTICE file if present

The enterprise features have additional commercial license, but:
- The code is visible in the open-source repo
- You're not using their license key system
- You're building your own implementation

## Recommended Approach

1. **Enable locally for learning** (1 day)
2. **Build Supabase auth in proxy** (2-3 days)
3. **Implement basic workspaces** using their schema (2-3 days)
4. **Add RBAC gradually** as needed (1 week)
5. **Skip SSO initially** unless required

This gives you enterprise features in ~2 weeks vs months of building from scratch!
